# Meat App

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

Run `json-server db.json` to start the mock server. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Why?

This project was created to practice what I was learning in the Udemy Course on Angular.

## Ok, but what does it do? 

It's a delivery food app. 
Basically, the user will be presented with a list of restaurants that he / she can choose from and then add products from those restaurants to the shopping cart. After informing he/she address and confirm the order, the system will register that order.
